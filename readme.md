Inclement Weather for Plants:

This script prompts the user to enter a zip code and country code, retrieves location data for that city using the Open Weather Geocoding API, then sends the latitude and longitude for given location to retrieve weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
The script then notifies the user based on predefined thresholds for adverse weather conditions. 
You can adjust the conditions and notifications according to your preferences.

Future implementations:
Plant database with predetermined thresholds.
